    "the new example-branch could have it's own files and its own versions of files that are present in main, it's really like a parallel universe!\n",

    "Branches are useful when we want to add a new feature or to fix a bug, that way we create a branch called bug-fix (in the example of fixing a bug), and work on the project simultaneously without affecting the main project (we are branching-off), even if we have problems in our current project that won't affect the live project because it's getting served by the main branch.\n",
